# Primary Vertex Reconstruction
# Analysis Tools

We will need different measures to verify how well the reconstruction is working.

- **Find the position of the “interesting” vertex (Signal event vertex):**
  - **Efficiency:** How many of the simulated signal vertices are reconstructed?
  - **Precision:** How close are the positions of the simulated and reconstructed vertices for signal events?
  - How often is the signal event also reconstructed as the signal event?
  
- **Identify other pile-up vertices:**
  - **Efficiency:** How many of the simulated vertices are reconstructed?
  - **Purity:** How many of the reconstructed vertices are incorrect? This controls for false positives and keeps the error rate small.
  - **Precision:** How close are the positions of the simulated and reconstructed vertices?
  - Where on the z-axis are the reconstructed and simulated vertices? What is the **distribution**?
  
- **Determine the number of pile-up vertices event-by-event:** How many events are there for each simulation?

- **Track--Vertex assignment:** For each simulated and reconstructed pair, how many of their associated tracks match (in percentage)?
