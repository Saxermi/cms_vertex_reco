# Primary Vertex Reconstruction
# Analysis Tools
We will need different measures to verify how well the reconstruction is working.

<ul>
  <li> Find the position of the “interesting” vertex
    <ul>
      <li>**Efficiency:** How many of the simulated signal vertices are reconstructed?</li>
      <li>**Precision:** How close are the positions of the simulated vertices and their reconstructed counterparts for signal events?</li>
      <li>How often is the signal event also reconstructed as the signal event?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identify other pile-up vertices
    <ul>
      <li>**Efficiency:** How many of the simulated vertices are reconstructed?</li>
      <li>**Purity:** How many of the reconstructed vertices are incorrect? This controls for false positives and keeps the error rate small.</li>
      <li>**Precision:** How close are the positions of the simulated vertices and their reconstructed counterparts?</li>
      <li>Where on the z-axis are the reconstructed and simulated vertices? How is the **distribution**?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>**Determine the number of pile-up vertices event-by-event:** How many events are there for each simulation?</li>
  <li>**Track--Vertex assignment:** For each simulated and reconstructed pair, how many of their associated tracks match (in percentage)?</li>
</ul>
